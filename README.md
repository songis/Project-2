####Isaiah Song
This is a simple program designed to plot microbial growth readings over time and calculate the estimated rate of growth based on data provided by the user.  It consists of three functions: readData reads in the data and stores it as a table, plotData gives a visual representation of the data as a dot plot, and analyzeData plots the data in a logarithmic graph to estimate the rate of growth during the organism's exponential growth phase.  The instructions for using the program will be shown below using two example datasets: "Sample OD Readings.txt" and "Sample OD Readings.txt 2."

1. Reading in user data (readData)

jj

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
